Node.js is an efficient, light weight and cross platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. LambdaTest enables node.js scripts to run on the Selenium automation grid.

This tutorial will help you run Nodejs automation scripts over LambdaTest Selenium Grid.

## Prerequisites

1. General Setup - This include Downloading Selenium Webdriver and Setting up Environment variables.

   1. Install **Selenium Dependencies**

   ```
   npm install selenium-webdriver -g
   ```

   2. **LambdaTest Authentication Credentials** - You can get these from [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/). Set Environment Variables / If you don't want to set environments you have to add USERNAME and ACCESS_TOKEN in index.js file manually.
   <p align="center">
    <b>For Linux/macOS:</b>:

   ```
   export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
   export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
   ```

   <p align="center">
   <b>For Windows:</b>

   ```
   set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
   set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
   ```

2. **Node.js and Package Manager (npm)** : Install Node.js from their [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Or Install Node.js using command line. Go to the terminal or command prompt & run the below command.

<p align="center">
   <b>For Linux/macOS:</b>:
 
```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

<p align="center">
   <b>For Windows:</b>

```
1. Go to -  https://nodejs.org/en/download/. And Download and install Windows Installer.
```

## Setting Up The Project

- **Step 1** : Create a seperate directory _my-first-test_. Now go into the directory and Clone this repository.

```
cd my-first-test
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample.git
```

- **Step 2** : Run the following command to run your first Javascript test on LambdaTest Selenium Grid.

```
node index.js
```

## Congratulation You Successfully executed your first Javascript Test.

### Understanding the Code.

The test script will do the following actions:

1. Invoke the browser launch.
2. Go to [www.google.com](http://www.google.com).
3. Type LambdaTest in the search box.
4. Fetch the title of the web page.
5. Close the browser and display the fetched title in the console.

Thatâ€™s it. Before we deep dive into the test script, we need to declare our desired capabilities. These desired capabilities will help us define the testing environment such as browser version, operating system, and more. You can leverage [LambdaTest Desired Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) to specify the desired capabilities class.

### [LambdaTest Desired Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)

Let us fetch the desired capabilities class from the LambdaTest Desired Capabilities Generator to run the script on LambdaTest cloud-based Selenium Grid.

![LambdaTest Desired Capabilities](https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample/blob/master/tutorial-images/lambdaTest%20desired%20capabilities%20generator.png)

With the capability generator, you can specify a variety of configurations in multiple programming languages.

With that said, let us look into the test script **index.js**.

```
const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');

// USERNAME & KEY can be found at automation dashboard
const USERNAME = 'shwetas';
const KEY = 'xhfQswR5454';

// gridUrl: gridUrl can be found at automation dashboard
const GRID_HOST = 'hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub';

function searchTextOnGoogle() {

    // Setup Input capabilities
    const capabilities = {
        platform: 'windows 10',
        browserName: 'firefox',
        version: 'latest',
        resolution: '1280x800',
        geoLocation :'IT',
        network: false,
        visual: false,
        console: false,
        video: true,
        name: 'Test 1', // name of the test
        build: 'NodeJS build' // name of the build
    }

    // URL: https://{username}:{accessToken}@beta-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub
    const gridUrl = 'https://' + USERNAME + ':' + KEY + '@' + GRID_HOST;

    // setup and build selenium driver object
    const driver = new webdriver.Builder()
        .usingServer(gridUrl)
        .withCapabilities(capabilities)
        .build();

    // navigate to a url, search for a text and get title of page
    driver.get('https://www.google.com/ncr').then(function() {
        driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('q')).sendKeys('LambdaTest\n').then(function() {
            driver.getTitle().then(function(title) {
                setTimeout(function() {
                    console.log(title);
                    driver.executeScript('lambda-status=passed');
                    driver.quit();
                }, 5000);
            });
        });
    }).catch(function(err){
        console.log("test failed with reason "+err)
        driver.executeScript('lambda-status=failed');
        driver.quit();
    });
}
searchTextOnGoogle()
```

## Running The Test

Open the command line in the same directory where the GitHub repository for nodejs tutorial is cloned & run the below command.

```
node index.js
```

Once the test case is executed, you can assess its status over the LambdaTest Automation Dashboard. You can figure out whether the test has passed or failed. You can also review various kinds of test logs such as network logs, command logs, raw Selenium logs, and even video recording of the entire test execution.

If you notice your console output in the command prompt or terminal. You will find the below output.

### Test Your Locally Hosted Web Applications

You can also perform cross browser testing of your web application which is locally hosted using Lambda Tunnel. Lambda Tunnel establishes a secure shell connection between your localhost and our cloud servers to help you execute Selenium test automation for privately hosted projects. All you need to do is set the tunnel variable as true in your desired capabilities for running your Selenium script with Lambda Tunnel.

- Set **tunnel = true**
- Set **truetunnelName = 'Identifier name'** (recommended in case of more than 1 tunnels are connected)

For example, to run the above test script through your localhost, your desired capabilities will be:

```
const capabilities = {
        platform: 'windows 10',
        browserName: 'firefox',
        version: 'latest',
        resolution: '1280x800',
        network: false,
        visual: false,
        console: false,
        video: true,
        tunnel: true, // flag to run Selenium script on Lambda Tunnel
        name: 'Test 1',
        build: 'NodeJS build'
```

It is important to note that you would need to download the Lambda Tunnel binary file for your operating system. Refer to our support documentation for more information on [Lambda Tunnel](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/).

### Want To Run Lambda Tunnel Without Using Command Line?

Download the Underpass app for your operating system. Refer to our support documentation for more information on [Lambda Underpass-tunnel-app](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/underpass-tunnel-application/).
